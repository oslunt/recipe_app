      "instructions": "Mix the dry team in a small bowl. The wet team except egg goes in a saucepan. Heat, stirring frequently until melted and sugar dissolved. Let sit for 5 minutes. Mix in the dry team and then the egg. Seal in cling wrap; refrigerate 24-48 hours. Time lets the dough blend and mature.\nRoll into two 4-inch snakes, cut into 4-inch slugs (~17g). Roll in balls and place on silicon or parchment lining. Chill for 20-30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees for ~10 minutes. Cool completely, dip in glaze. You can thin the glaze with hot water as desired.\n\n*To reduce the amount of kick to these cookies, eliminate the ginger and black pepper. To increase the kick, you can add more of these two spices.\n\n(Could try decorating with chocolate drizzle, orange zest + lemon zest)\n\nLebkuchengewürz recipe: https://www.daringgourmet.com/homemade-lebkuchengewuerz-german-gingerbread-spice-blend/"
